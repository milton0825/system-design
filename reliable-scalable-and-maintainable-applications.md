# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

## Reliability
The system should continue to work corrected even when there are hardware faults (disk crashes),
software faults (slow downstream dependency), or human faults (wrong configuration by operator).

## Scalability
The system should be able to cope with increasing load.

## Maintainability
The system aims to make life easier for the engineering team and operation team. The complexity of
the system should be manageable by introducing proper abstraction.
